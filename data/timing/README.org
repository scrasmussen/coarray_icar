* particle timing results
500 time steps
small size
stopped at particle size 40 mill because it took more than 12 hours to complete,
 - job failed


* cray dataframe
in the past dataframe has not had n_nodes or halo_size
header = ['nx','nz','ny','np','x_images','y_images','n_particles','timesteps',
          'time', 'halo_size', 'n_nodes']


* removed plot points
